### Data Workflow

### automated runs ###

# Original Data

-> ADV
	ADV_Ortstabelle_Hessen.xlsx (original data)

-> Wenker Places
	alle_wenkerorte.txt

### Level 0 - first run automated matching
	using ADV_Ortstabelle_Hessen.xlsx 
	results not saved -.-
	visual validation shows that some names in ADV differ to todays names.

# modify org data

-> 002_corrected_names.xlsx (from Heiko Kammers)
	add corrected names for all "not detected" in first run
	But is only those names (not full table)
	! first run did not use "no unique names" case detection.
	! may be some more or less names would have been corrected?

-> 003_ADV_final_clean.csv
	add ADV_corrected.xlsx to all entries which are else than "not detected" in first run
	for "ortsamne" using corrected names, all other keep name. 
	Add column for "old_names" (if has been corrected)

### Level 1 - second run with cleaned dataset (new names)
-> Second run automated detection
	-> ADV_automatch_level_1.csv
	-> ADV_Points_level_1.shp
	added new feture to detect "no unique names" for the case ADV names occure more than 1 times	

	result: still some points "not detected" as well as "multiple entires" and "no unqiue names" (multiple names in ADV)

### Level 2 - handsome clean up and detection


-> corrections_ADV_level_1.csv
	add tag for "false detected" (if sector validation didnt match)
	add coordinates for multiple entires detected and no unique names (Manuel Oed)
	! missing header and UniCode Problems

-> ADV_level_1_corrections_clean.csv
	corrected header (mod in excel (Andreas SchÃ¶nberg))


ADV_level_2.csv
	merged ADV_level_1_corrections_clean.csv and ADV_automatch_level_1.csv

### Level 3 - not detected and new entries (Kammers)

not_detected_Kammers.ods
	ods format causes problems in R

ADV_Level_1_not_detected.csv
	delete empty rows (between not detected found and the added nerw entries)
	added IDs for new entries (starting with 1271+1) (max ADV+1)

	merge ADV_Level_1_not_detected.csv with ADV_level_2.csv
	drop all "not deteced" entries. Add all from new table including new added (not formal "Not detected")

### Level 4 - Final Table

	-> ADV_level_3 Aktuell.csv - Added Coordinates to ADV_level_3.csv for all still not found (in LVL3) by Heiko
	again version / system issues
	
	Handsome assigning new coordinates to  ADV_level_3.csv
	-> ADV_level_3 Aktuell.csv is sorted by coordinates (so 999 is up)
	-> same sorting for ADV_level_3.csv in Ecxel
	-> copy paste coordinates and add tag "found"

	Result: ADV_level_3_add_test.csv
	!!! warning: to visual detect points in very close neigborhood use Mapview in R or for Qgis the option "blending mode featzure multiply"

Handsome correction: directly chnaging coorinates in Excel with tag "handsome corrected"
